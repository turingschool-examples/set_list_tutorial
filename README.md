# ActiveRecord Associations Practice

This branch includes practice exercises for ActiveRecord associations. Work on the exercises in this order:


1. `spec/models/artist_spec.rb`
1. `spec/models/song_spec.rb`
1. `spec/models/record_label_spec.rb`

Start by running one test at a time. For the first test, you should run `bundle exec rspec spec/models/artist_spec.rb:15`. Including the line number of the test will help you stay focused on one exercise at a time.

Avoid running all the tests at once (`bundle exec rspec`). This will error out since the `RecordLabel` class hasn't been created yet.

Make sure to read the comments in each test. They include instructions on how you should approach the problem. 
In addition, let any errors guide your implementation. If you get an error, **be sure to read the entire error message**!
